## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a third year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a minor in Physics. I am interested in engineering education and product design. I want to make complex engineering and physics topics more accessible to everyone. On campus, I am on the AutoBoat project team on the hull design and manufacturing subteam. This year, I worked on the internal rib structure of the main hull and amas. I have found a lot of joy in sharing my knowledge of CAD and ANSYS FEA with the new members this year and watching all of our projects come together to make a new automated boat. 

Outside of engineering, I participated as a learning assistant in the Physics department where I worked alongside a graduate TA in a discussion section for Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism. I am now a tutor in the Physics Learning Strategy Center where I help on average 5 students per 2 hour session with a variety of introductory physics courses. I am also in both the marching and pep bands on campus where I serve as a rank leader responsible for teaching 5 new members how to march. 

On this site, you can learn more about my past projects, resume, and relevant courses.

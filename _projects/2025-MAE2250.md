This project consisted of the idea generation, design, prototyping, and iteration of a versatile water bottle cleaner. The focus of the design was usability as the main focus combining the functionality of multiple brushes into one compact tool. I paid extra attention to ensuring the cleaner could reach all aspects of a complicated water bottle geometry. 

This project was for the class, MAE 2250 - Introduction to Mechanical Design and combines skills such as CAD modeling and rendering using Fusion360, hands-on prototyping, and presenting. I was tasked to work in a group of 5 people to research and design a new product for an open design project (ODP). I mainly focused on prototyping and helping out my group to complete the weekly assignments.

This project focused on a torque wrench modeled as a version as a cantilever beam with a fixed drive on one end and a load on the opposite end. I was given a baseline design. I was then tasked with modifying the major dimensions (length, width, and height) of the beam as well as the material to optimize the torque wrench. 

The constraints I was given were: safety factor of Xo = 4 for yield failure, safety factor of XK = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches, fatigue stress safety factor of XS = 1.5, and the material must be a steel, aluminum or titanium alloy

I worked on this project with Anna Fulbright. I focused on writing the MATLAB script to perform hand calculations on both the baseline design and our design iterations. I also performed FEA using ANSYS Workbench on the baseline design and our final iteration.

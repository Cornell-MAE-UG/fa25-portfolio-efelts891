For this project, I chose to look at a dehumidifier from a thermodynamic perspective. This device works by taking humid air (water vapor and air mixture) and blowing it across cold coils in the form of a heat exchanger. The water vapor goes through a phase change and collects in a bucket as liquid water. The coils have a refrigerant pumped through them. The refrigerant is compressed in a compressor after passing through the coils where heat is transferred to the surrounding air. On average, a dehumidifier can remove 20 pints of water out of the air per day at 25 C. A typical dehumidifier uses 500W of power. If the operating temperature was higher, the water vapor would need to be cooled more to become a liquid. This means more power would be needed to remove heat from the refrigerant so that it can continue to cool the water vapor.

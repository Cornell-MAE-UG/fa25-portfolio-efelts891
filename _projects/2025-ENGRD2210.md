This past summer, I noticed that a dehumidifier I was using to dry out my grandma’s basement was expelling heat to the surroundings. For this project, I chose to look at a dehumidifier from a thermodynamic perspective to investigate how much heat went to the surrounding. This device works by taking humid air (water vapor and air mixture) and blowing it across cold coils in the form of a heat exchanger. The humid air contains water vapor which goes through a phase change and collects in a bucket as liquid water. The coils have a refrigerant pumped through them. The refrigerant is compressed in a compressor after passing through the coils where heat is transferred to the surrounding air. On average, a dehumidifier can remove 20 pints of water out of the air per day at 25 C. A typical dehumidifier uses 500W of power, according to the sources listed below. If the operating temperature was higher, the water vapor would need to be cooled more to become a liquid. This means more power would be needed to remove heat from the refrigerant so that it can continue to cool the water vapor.

In the work presented on this page, I modeled the dehumidifier as a heat exchanger, since this was the most important part of the dehumidifier. I did this by doing an energy balance on a control volume on the heat exchanger. I chose to neglect kinetic and potential energy changes because my experience with a dehumidifier is that dehumidifiers are not very tall, thus no significant change in gravitational potential energy of any of the fluids. I neglected kinetic energy changes because nearly all of the fluids involved in the system are gases with a large amount of kinetic energy. I assumed the change in enthalpy of the air is zero because most of the heat transfer occurs between the refrigerant and the water. Using a conservation of energy, I was able to find the amount of heat expelled out of the water into the surroundings from a dehumidifier.
